Default: some number
Description: New partition size:
 The minimum size for this partition is ${MINSIZE} (or ${PERCENT}) and its
 maximum size is ${MAXSIZE}.

 Hint: "max" can be used as a shortcut to specify the maximum size, or
 enter a percentage (e.g. "20%") to use that percentage of the maximum size.

Template: partman-partitioning/bad_new_size
Type: error
Description: The size entered is invalid
 The size you entered was not understood.
 Please enter a positive integer size followed by an optional unit of measure
 (e.g. "200 GB"). The default unit of measure is the megabyte.

Template: partman-partitioning/big_new_size

Template: partman-partitioning/unknown_label
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Continue with partitioning?
 This partitioner doesn't have information about the default type of
 the partition tables on your architecture.  Please send an e-mail
 message to debian-boot@lists.debian.org with information.
 .
 Please note that if the type of the partition table is unsupported by
 libparted, then this partitioner will not work properly.

Template: partman-partitioning/unsupported_label
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Continue with partitioning?
 This partitioner is based on the library libparted which doesn't have
 support for the partition tables used on your architecture.  It is
 strongly recommended that you exit this partitioner.
 .
 If you can, please help to add support for your partition table type
 to libparted.

Template: partman-partitioning/default_label
Type: string
Description: for internal use; can be preseeded
 You may preseed this template to override the partitioner's
 platform-specific default choice of disk label.  For example, on x86
 architectures it may be useful to set this to "gpt" to cause new partition
 tables to be created using GPT.

Template: partman-partitioning/choose_label
Type: select
Choices: ${CHOICES}
Description: Partition table type:
 Select the type of partition table to use.

Template: partman-partitioning/confirm_new_label
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Create new empty partition table on this device?
 You have selected an entire device to partition. If you proceed with
 creating a new partition table on the device, then all current partitions
 will be removed.
 .
 Note that you will be able to undo this operation later if you wish.

Template: partman-partitioning/confirm_write_new_label
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Write a new empty partition table?
 Because of limitations in the current implementation of the Sun
 partition tables in libparted, the newly created partition table has
 to be written to the disk immediately.
 .
 You will NOT be able to undo this operation later and all existing
 data on the disk will be irreversibly removed.
 .
 Confirm whether you actually want to create a new partition table and
 write it to disk.

Template: partman-partitioning/bootable_logical
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Are you sure you want a bootable logical partition?
 You are trying to set the bootable flag on a logical partition. The
 bootable flag is generally only useful on primary partitions, so setting it
 on logical partitions is normally discouraged. Some BIOS versions are known
 to fail to boot if there is no bootable primary partition.
 .
 However, if you are sure that your BIOS does not have this problem, or if
 you are using a custom boot manager that pays attention to bootable logical
 partitions, then setting this flag may make sense.
