  * parted 2.1 changed the semantics of ped_disk_clobber: it now zeroes out
    the first few and last few sectors of the disk, regardless of whether
    there appears to be a valid partition table on it.  Unfortunately, this
    means that creating a filesystem on a whole disk device and then calling
    ped_disk_commit_to_dev zeroes the filesystem header we just created.  To
    avoid this, call ped_disk_commit_to_dev only if the partition doesn't
    start at sector zero (LP: #539324, #549260).
  * Check return values from asprintf for memory allocation failures.
  * Ignore free space smaller than the grain size of the partition creation
    constraint, rather than only free space smaller than a cylinder.
  * Always leave a small gap at the end of the disk (except on device-mapper
    devices), to avoid confusing mdadm by leaving the MD 0.90 superblock at
    the end of the disk as well as the end of a partition (LP: #527401).
  * Allow preseeding partman/alignment to "cylinder", "minimal", or
    "optimal"; "cylinder" restores old alignment behaviour for the benefit
    of those with crotchety BIOSes, while "optimal" is the default.
  * Don't apply optimal alignment to extended partitions (LP: #558382).

  * Upgrade to debhelper v7.
  * Fix typo in partman-command that broke commands such as "partman-command
    /dev/sda IS_CHANGED".
  * Merge from Ubuntu:
    - Call sed outside debconf_select's inner loop. In my benchmarks using
      two disks with eight partitions each, this reduces debconf_select's
      runtime on partman/choose_partition from 0.69 seconds to 0.07 seconds.
    - Cache the output of partition_tree_choices for each disk, invalidating
      the cache whenever we update a partition on the disk. In the above
      benchmark, this saves on the order of half a second every time we
      redisplay the partition tree when nothing has changed (e.g. on backing
      up from a partition).

  * Merge from Ubuntu:
    - Disable backup while displaying device/partition locked errors; it
      makes no sense and it can cause us to exit without closing the FIFO to
      parted_server (closes: #505477, LP: #274219).
    - Add support for explicit 'b' or 'B' suffixes on partition sizes to
      force interpretation as bytes (closes: #322922).
    - Add a small test suite for longint2human and human2longint.
    - Exclude /dev/ramzswap devices (http://code.google.com/p/compcache/).
    - Add partman/early_command hook to run arbitrary commands immediately
      before partitioning (LP: #239348).
    - Exit straight away if a called script is killed by a signal.
    - Only mark the partition table as changed due to CHANGE_FILE_SYSTEM if
      it actually makes a change (i.e. the partition wasn't already using
      that filesystem or didn't have that flag set). This avoids the
      partition table being rewritten even if partman did nothing more than
      autousing swap (LP: #287660).
    - Add partman/default_filesystem template so that we can remove
      hardcoding of ext3 from elsewhere in partman, and make the default
      filesystem preseedable.
    - Check dmraid's exit code rather than parsing its output.
    - Don't display the Back button when asking for confirmation, since it's
      already a boolean "do you want to continue?" question and we ignore
      backup anyway (LP: #9244).
    - Cope with exception options, partition flags passed to SET_FLAGS, and
      the partition name passed to SET_NAME being empty (closes: #268495).
    - Use 'update-dev --settle' rather than 'update-dev' during commit.
      Requires di-utils 1.66.
  * Run 'depmod -a' after loading extra partman components, since they might
    install further kernel modules as dependencies.
  * Mark partman/exception_handler and partman/exception_handler_note unseen
    before asking them; they're effectively error messages but implemented
    using select and boolean templates, so won't necessarily be reshown
    otherwise, and failures may be very confusing if these aren't shown.

  * Apply patch by Ian Campbell and Ferenc Wagner to improve display of Xen
    virtual disks in partman. With thanks to both. Closes: #474556.
  * In lowmem mode it is possible that newly loaded support for a file system
    is not "seen" because depmod has not been run after loading the kernel
    udeb. Therefore, run depmod when partman is started.
    Also fixes missing file system support (including ext2/3) for s390.

  * Move definitions.sh to ./lib/base.sh. Temporarily provide a symlink to the
    old location to ease the transition.
  * base.sh: add memfree function which returns free memory in kB.
  * Reorganization of partition label related code to partman-partitioning:
    - move function default_disk_label from base.sh to disk-label.sh
    - move init.d/unsupported
    - move partman/*_label templates
    - depend on partman-partitioning (>= 54) so other components can just
      depend on this version of partman-base
    Part of this change was originally suggested by Jérémy Bobbio.
  * Only load components for LVM and crypto support when there is sufficient
    free memory. For crypto this only loads base support components;
    additional crypto components will only be loaded on demand. Support for
    guided (encrypted) LVM partitioning is only loaded if partman-auto was

  * Resolve symlinks before looking up devices in /proc/swaps.
  * Minor read_list optimisation using a ${parameter:+word} expansion.
  * Optimise humandev cciss handling a little, fixing a shell syntax error
    along the way that created a file called "15" rather than checking
    whether $lun was greater than 15.
  * Use 'mkdir -p' rather than more awkward test-then-create constructions.
  * If devices are passed as command-line arguments to parted_devices,
    iterate over them rather than over the list of devices probed by
    libparted. This can be useful to support devices that libparted would
    not normally probe automatically, such as loop devices. (Read-only
    devices, CDs, and floppies are still skipped.)
  * Use expr rather than shell arithmetic in human2longint, to avoid relying
    on 64-bit shell arithmetic.
  * Use MS-DOS label by default on Cell platforms.

      from substvars won't work. The only reason we got libparted1.6-udeb

    - definitions.sh (partition_tree_choices): shorten the indent of the
      partitions; visual.d/name: change the width of the name from 14->12.
      These changes are because dvh disk labels have both primary/logical
      partitions and partition names so the space is not enough for the

    - creation of new label should ignore the non-zero codes returned by
      storage_device/label/do_option.
    - visual.d/filesystem: show the unusable free spaces as "unusable"
      instead of "FREE SPACE".  Most of the partition table types do not
      have extended and logical partitions and there was no indication in
      the main menu when some free space is unusable.
    - move the confirmation dialog for the creation of new label from here
      to partman-partitioning.
    - for s390, make partman not to be default partitioner, as it does not
      handle ibm disk labels.
    - for m68k, do the same since partman is quiet slow here and doesn't

    - I observed that the type of the partition is not translatable.  So I
      added four new templates - "primary", "logical", "pri/log" and
      "unusable".  Sorry, translators - without the new templates
      these strings would be left untranslated anyway.
    - a necessary change for SPARCs.  Because of bug/limitation in the
      implementation of the Sun disk labels in libparted they must be
      written to the disk before any consequent edition.  Because of that
      a new template had to be added (it is going to be used only on SPARCs).
    - these changes are still not used by the other code of partman.
  * Joey Hess
    - Parameterise the menu-item-number.
    - For arm, make partman not be the default partitioner, as it does not
      handle 4 partitioning schemes used by arm subarches.
    - For mips, do the same, since parted does not know about dvh
      partitioning. Also because it's kinda slow (15 minutes on a fast indy).
    - Minor polishing of the new template.

    - Make ask_user use a default_choice file (insteas of last_choice).
    - Add a menudir_default_choice function which sets the default_choice of a
      menudir to the output of the given menu items's choices script.
    - Make debconf_select only set the default if a default is passed into
      it, to allow for database preseeding.
    - Stop using non-breaking spaces, using new space escape code in
      recent cdebconf. Fixes display on non-framebuffer terminal.
      (Anton Zinoviev: I reenabled non-breaking spaces as I can not use
      escaped spaces.  Properly setup non-framebuffer terminal must be
      able to display non-break spaces.)
    - Enhance confirm_new_label template text.

    - new release
  * Joey Hess
    - reformatted the main screen

    - removed not very useful/redundant commit and abort choices from
      choose_partition
    - added a confirmation message on partman exit to make sure the user does
      not accidentially destroy his data
    - shorten title to work around cdebconf bug

    - change menu item number to 42 so it's the default partitioner
      (should this only be on i386?)

partman (11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Anton Zinoviev
    - in the menu for a storage device added new item to cancel the menu
      (for debconf frontends without back button)
    - sort the storage devices so that for example the devices on the
      second IDE channel are not listed before the devices on the first
      IDE channel
    - in the main menu: swap finish and undo.  Changed the text of finish
      and abort
    - renumbered init.d/update_partitions (90->70),
      init.d/filesystems_detected (91->71) and active_partition/finish
      (99->75)
    - deactivated active_partition/chs (put "exit 0" in choices script)
    - fixed bug in update.d/visual causing only the first word of the
      partition name to be shown in the main menu
    - visual.d/filesystem uses template partman/filesystem_short/... as
      said in the new version of the documentation.
    - definitions.sh (error_handler): added support for new undocumented
      exception type 'No Implementation'
    - definitions.sh (error_handler): use partman/exception_handler_note
      instead of partman/exception_handler when there is only one one
      alternative
    - parted_server.c (command_get_resize_range): add
      deactivate_exception_handler
    - parted_server.c (resize_partition): add check for the case when
      there is a file system but it can not be opened
    - debian/templates: state that `partition the storage devices' is an
      alternative partitioner rather than additional partitioning step in
      the installer process

partman (10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Anton Zinoviev
    - Partman doesn't rely any more on partconf-mkfstab to convert devfs
      devices to normal devices.  A new command map_devfs does this using
      directly libdebian-installer.
    - Add dependency on libdebian-installer4-udeb and build-dependency on
      libdebian-installer4-dev.
    - Use 32 instead of 40 as number for update-dev in commit.d to make
      the room between update-dev and the next script larger.
    - Use 20 instead of 90 as number for remove_backup in commit.d.
      Otherwise `undo' can restore invalid partition scheme.
    - Removed probably unnecessary loop in the abort function of /bin/partman.

      corrupted if a comment appears before the Template line, as
      before the partman/active_partition template.  Closes: #232489
