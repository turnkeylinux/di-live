  * Bump /boot sizes in most recipes from between 128 and 256M to
    between 512 and 768M.  As initramfs keep growing, and kernel ABI
    bumps keep happening, running out of space on /boot is unpleasant.
    Closes: #893886, 951709.
  * Import from Ubuntu: Introduce partman-auto/cap-ram, to allow capping RAM
    size as used for swap partition calculations. This allows us to cap the
    minimum size of swap partitions size to 1*CAP, and their maximum size to a
    maximum of 2 or 3*CAP depending on architecture. Default is set to 1024,
    thus capping swap partitions to between 1 and 3GB. LP: #1351267, closes:
    #949651, #950344.  Patch from Dimitri John Ledkov.

  * Update partition layout defaults:
    - atomic:
      - Set minimimum size of / partition to 900 MB for platforms without
        separate /boot partition and to 800 MB for those with /boot.
    - home:
      - Increase maximum size of / partition to 20 GB or 30 GB, depending
        on the platform.
      - Increase minimum size of / partition to 1500 MB and of /home to
        1000 MB.  This allocates more space to the / partition on smaller
        disks and ensures the separate /home option is not offered on 2 GB
        disks.
      - Increase priority of / partition so more space is allocated to it
        on small disks.  Closes: #770032
    - multi:
      - Increase maximum size of / partition to 25 GB.  Closes: #725642
      - Increase maximum size of /var partition to 10 GB.  Closes: #803604
      - Increase maximum size of /tmp partition to 2 GB.
      - Increase minimum size of / partition to 2000 MB, of /var to 1000 MB,
        of /tmp to 256 MB and of /home to 4000 MB.  This ensures that this
        option is no longer offered on 4 GB disks.
      - Increase priority of /home partition since most space should be
        allocated to it.
      - Increase priority of /tmp partition so more than the minimum is
        allocated to it.
      - Adjust priority of / partition in relation to other partitions.

  * Fix $iflabel{ } logic to avoid including the partition anyway if the
    current directory is not a subdirectory of /var/lib/partman/devices.
    This caused automatic LVM partitioning to be calculated with a biosgrub
    partition regardless of the disk label type, although as it happened
    this cancelled out with another bug so that partition would never
    actually be written to disk (LP: #538536).
  * Run clean_method before starting autopartitioning instead of in the
    middle of performing a recipe, and call autopartition just once for
    multi-disk partitioning.  This means that methods applied to partitions
    of physical disks in RAID recipes are applied to all disks rather than
    just the last one (LP: #566965).

  * Also set free_type in wipe_disk as that is needed by the function
    create_primary_partitions. This allows partman-auto-lvm to actually create
    the /boot partition as a primary partition.
  * Allow to include definitions of partitions in regular recipes that should
    only be used for a certain type of auto partitioning. This is useful to
    allow e.g. a definition for a /boot partition to be included that is not
    to be used for regular auto partitioning, but is needed for auto-lvm.
    The actual implementation is in reverse as that seems more flexible: a
    partition can be marked using "$<type>ignore" (where <type> is default or
    lvm) and will then not be included. Multiple ignore marks are possible.
    To implement this, the functions choose_recipe and decode_recipe now take
    an extra argument indicating the type of autopartitioning being done.

  * Change descriptions of home and multi recipes to just list the partitions

  * Double the weight of the root partition in the multi scheme from 400 to

    from the previous 250 mb to something slightly more reasonable.
    Closes: #328514

  * Add a smalldisk recipe for alpha, so that systems with little disk space
    can use a single ext2 partition for the whole install (closes: #261182).

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Remove duplicated chrp_rs6k recipes and install a symlink instead.

  [ Fabio M. Di Nitto ]
  * Start implementing bits required to avoid code duplication with
    partman-auto-lvm as per discussion on debian-boot mailing list.
    (See http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2005/10/msg00842.html)
  * Add lvmok{ } to recipes as per discussion on debian-boot mailing list.
    NOTES:
      - nobody objected to a tag/properties/flag name or proposed something
        different. It is clearly ok to rename it if it doesn't fit.
      - swap will stay out of LVM for now. In some cases it is known to break
        suspend/resume. It seems not all kernels are able to resume from it.
      - porters will have to adjust their recipes. I could only test
        i386/amd64 (via recipes) and powerpc-powermac_newworld (via
        recipes-powerpc-powermac_newworld).
  * Move common code into auto-shared.sh shelllib and create 3 functions:
    wipe_disk, create_primary_partitions (see comments in the file) and
    create_partitions.
  * Install auto-shared.sh in /lib/partman (chages debian/rules)
  * Make perform_recipe and autopartition use auto-shared.sh.
  * Make create_partitions set a var for all the devices that will be marked
    as pv. This is actually only used by partman-auto-lvm, but it is generic
    enough that could be used later on for other tasks.
    NOTES: the above changes have been tested on i386/amd64/ppc and there is
    no known breakage. The code is only moved around and none of the actual
    recipes use method{ lvm } used by partman-auto-lvm to mark partitions as
    pv volumes.

partman-auto (8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Anton Zinoviev
    - automatically_partition/some_device/do_option: creates new partition
      table with the default for the architecture type.  Closes: #235923
    - perform_recipe: start progress bar, as autopartitioning can be quiet
      slow
  * Joey Hess
    - add xfs and reiserfs to the valid fs list (should this use info from the
      plugins?)
    - if there is no valid recipe, bail with an error instead of hanging.

    - Use a different question for the initial autopartitioning.
    - After autopartitioning, set the default menu item on choose_partitions
      to the one that finishes the install. Closes: #235900

    - new files: perform_recipe and recipes.sh
    - extract most parts of autopartition to perform_recipe and
      recipes.sh
    - perform_recipe: remove all old method files.  Closes: #235194.
    - recipes.sh: new function choose_recipe

      Closes: #235377.
    - Scripts that include recipes.sh  include also definition.sh,
      recipes.sh doesn't include definitions.sh any more.
