 small to be automatically partitioned.

_Description: Partitioning method:
 The installer can guide you through partitioning a disk (using different
 standard schemes) or, if you prefer, you can do it manually. With guided
 partitioning you will still have a chance later to review and customise
 the results.
 .
 If you choose guided partitioning for an entire disk, you will next be
 asked which disk should be used.

Template: partman-auto/cap-ram
Type: string
Default: 1024
Description: for internal use; can be preseeded
 Cap RAM size to specified size in MB, when calculating the swap
 partition size. Defaults to 1024, meaning 1GB, and since swap is
 maximum 200% of RAM in the default recipes, it results in swap
 partitions to be capped at 2GB. To revert to previous behaviour of
 uncapped swap size with respect to available ram, preseed this key to
 any string, e.g. partman-auto/cap-ram=false
