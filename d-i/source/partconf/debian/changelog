    - Use libparted to iterate over disks and partitions in find-partitions

      default mount points for filesystems that can usefully be mounted
      automatically. The default mount points are in /media to match the
      behaviour of pmount.

    - Use getopt_long() for find-partitions option parsing. Support -i as

    - Add find-partitions -c/--colons output mode, which is easier to parse
