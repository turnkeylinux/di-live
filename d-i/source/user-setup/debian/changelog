  * Port Ubuntu changes from passwd.config:
    - Allow an empty root password, indicating the use of sudo.
    - Default to the above and only offer the root password question in
      expert mode.
    - Add the initial user to the adm, dip, lpadmin, and scanner groups too,
      and to the admin group if no root password is set.
    - Adjust /etc/aliases to send root mail to the initial user.
