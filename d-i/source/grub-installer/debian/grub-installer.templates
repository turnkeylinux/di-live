_Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to your primary drive?
 The following other operating systems have been detected on this
 computer: ${OS_LIST}
 .
 If all of your operating systems are listed above, then it should be safe to
 install the boot loader to your primary drive (UEFI partition/boot record).
 When your computer boots, you will be able to choose to load one of these
 operating systems or the newly installed Debian system.

_Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to your primary drive?
 It seems that this new installation is the only operating system
 on this computer. If so, it should be safe to install the GRUB boot loader
 to your primary drive (UEFI partition/boot record).
 .
 Warning: If your computer has another operating system that the installer
 failed to detect, this will make that operating system temporarily
 unbootable, though GRUB can be manually configured later to boot it.

_Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to the Serial ATA RAID disk?
 Installation of GRUB on Serial ATA RAID is experimental.
 .
 GRUB is always installed to the master boot record (MBR) of the
 Serial ATA RAID disk. It is also assumed that disk is listed as the
 first hard disk in the boot order defined in the system's BIOS setup.
 .
 The GRUB root device is: ${GRUBROOT}.

 Installation of GRUB on multipath is experimental.
 .
 GRUB is always installed to the master boot record (MBR) of the multipath
 device. It is also assumed that the WWID of this device is selected as boot
 device in the system's FibreChannel adapter BIOS.
 .
 The GRUB root device is: ${GRUBROOT}.

_Description: Device for boot loader installation:
 You need to make the newly installed system bootable, by installing
 the GRUB boot loader on a bootable device. The usual way to do this is to
 install GRUB to your primary drive (UEFI partition/boot record). You may
 instead install GRUB to a different drive (or partition), or to removable
 media.
 .
 The device notation should be specified as a device in /dev. Below are some
 examples:
  - "/dev/sda" will install GRUB to your primary drive (UEFI partition/boot
    record);
  - "/dev/sdb" will install GRUB to a secondary drive (which may for instance
    be a thumbdrive);
  - "/dev/fd0" will install GRUB to a floppy.

_Description: GRUB password:
 The GRUB boot loader offers many powerful interactive features, which could
 be used to compromise your system if unauthorized users have access to the
 machine when it is starting up. To defend against this, you may choose a
 password which will be required before editing menu entries or entering the
 GRUB command-line interface. By default, any user will still be able to
 start any menu entry without entering the password.
 .
 If you do not wish to set a GRUB password, leave this field blank.

_Description: Install GRUB?
 GRUB 2 is the next generation of GNU GRUB, the boot loader that is commonly
 used on i386/amd64 PCs. It is now also available for ${ARCH}.
 .
 It has interesting new features but is still experimental software
 for this architecture. If you choose to install it, you should be prepared
 for breakage, and have an idea on how to recover your system if it
 becomes unbootable. You're advised not to try this in production
 environments.

_Description: Force GRUB installation to the EFI removable media path?
 It seems that this computer is configured to boot via EFI, but maybe
 that configuration will not work for booting from the hard
 drive. Some EFI firmware implementations do not meet the EFI
 specification (i.e. they are buggy!) and do not support proper
 configuration of boot options from system hard drives.
 .
 A workaround for this problem is to install an extra copy of the EFI
 version of the GRUB boot loader to a fallback location, the
 "removable media path". Almost all EFI systems, no matter how buggy,
 will boot GRUB that way.
 .
 Warning: If the installer failed to detect another operating system
 that is present on your computer that also depends on this fallback,
 installing GRUB there will make that operating system temporarily
 unbootable. GRUB can be manually configured later to boot it if
 necessary.
