_Description: Help on partitioning
 Partitioning a hard drive consists of dividing it to create the space
 needed to install your new system.  You need to choose which
 partition(s) will be used for the installation.
 .
 Select a free space to create partitions in it.
 .
 Select a device to remove all partitions in it and create a new empty
 partition table.
 .
 Select a partition to remove it or to specify how it should be used.
 At a bare minimum, you need one partition to contain the root of the
 file system (whose mount point is /).  Most people also feel that a
 separate swap partition is a necessity.  "Swap" is scratch space for an
 operating system, which allows the system to use disk storage as
 "virtual memory".
 .
 When the partition is already formatted you may choose to keep and
 use the existing data in the partition.  Partitions that will be used
 in this way are marked with "${KEEP}" in the main partitioning menu.
 .
 In general you will want to format the partition with a newly created
 file system.  NOTE: all data in the partition will be irreversibly
 deleted.  If you decide to format a partition that is already
 formatted, it will be marked with "${DESTROY}" in the main
 partitioning menu.  Otherwise it will be marked with "${FORMAT}".

_Description: In order to start your new system, a so called boot loader is used.  It can be installed either in the master boot record of the first hard disk, or in a partition.  When the boot loader is installed in a partition, you must set the bootable flag for it. Such a partition will be marked with "${BOOTABLE}" in the main partitioning menu.

Template: partman-target/same_label
Type: error
# :sl2:
_Description: Identical labels for two file systems
 Two file systems are assigned the same label (${LABEL}): ${PART1} and
 ${PART2}. Since file system labels are usually used as unique identifiers,
 this is likely to cause reliability problems later.
 .
 Please correct this by changing labels.

Template: partman-target/same_mountpoint
Type: error
# :sl2:
_Description: Identical mount points for two file systems
 Two file systems are assigned the same mount point (${MOUNTPOINT}):
 ${PART1} and ${PART2}.
 .
 Please correct this by changing mount points.

_Description: No root file system
 No root file system is defined.

 Please correct this from the partitioning menu.

Template: partman-target/must_be_on_root
Type: error
# :sl2:
_Description: Separate file system not allowed here
 You assigned a separate file system to ${MOUNTPOINT}, but in order for
 the system to start correctly this directory must be on the root file
 system.
 .
 Please correct this from the partitioning menu.

_Description: Do you want to resume partitioning?
 The attempt to mount a file system with type ${TYPE} in ${DEVICE} at
 ${MOUNTPOINT} failed.

 You may resume partitioning from the partitioning menu.

Template: partman/mount_style
Type: select
Choices: traditional, label, uuid
Default: uuid
Description: for internal use; can be preseeded
 Normally, filesystems are mounted using a universally unique identifier
 (UUID) as a key; this allows them to be mounted properly even if their
 device name changes. UUIDs are long and difficult to read, so, if you
 prefer, the installer can mount filesystems based on the traditional device
 names, or based on a label you assign. However, note that traditional
 device names may change based on the order in which the kernel discovers
 devices at boot, which may cause the wrong filesystem to be mounted;
 similarly, labels are likely to clash if you plug in a new disk or a USB
 drive, and if that happens your system's behaviour when started will be
 random.
 .
 If you set "label" here, any filesystems without a label will be mounted
 using a UUID instead.
 .
 Devices with stable names, such as LVM logical volumes, will continue to
 use their traditional names rather than UUIDs.
