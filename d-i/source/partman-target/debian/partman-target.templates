_Description: Help on partitioning
 Partitioning a hard drive consists of dividing it to create the space
 needed to install your new system.  You need to choose which
 partition(s) will be used for the installation.
 .
 Select a free space to create partitions in it.
 .
 Select a device to remove all partitions in it and create a new empty
 partition table.
 .
 Select a partition to remove it or to specify how it should be used.
 At a bare minimum, you need one partition to contain the root of the
 file system (whose mount point is /).  Most people also feel that a
 separate swap partition is a necessity.  "Swap" is scratch space for an
 operating system, which allows the system to use disk storage as
 "virtual memory".
 .
 When the partition is already formatted you may choose to keep and
 use the existing data in the partition.  Partitions that will be used
 in this way are marked with "${KEEP}" in the main partitioning menu.
 .
 In general you will want to format the partition with a newly created
 file system.  NOTE: all data in the partition will be irreversibly
 deleted.  If you decide to format a partition that is already
 formatted, it will be marked with "${DESTROY}" in the main
 partitioning menu.  Otherwise it will be marked with "${FORMAT}".

_Description: In order to start your new system, a so called boot loader is used.  It can be installed either in the master boot record of the first hard disk, or in a partition.  When the boot loader is installed in a partition, you must set the bootable flag for it. Such a partition will be marked with "${BOOTABLE}" in the main partitioning menu.
