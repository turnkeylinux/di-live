Type: boolean

 back and set the bootable flag for the boot partition.

Template: partman-ext3/bad_alignment
Type: boolean
Description: Do you want to return to the partitioning menu?
 The partition ${PARTITION} assigned to ${MOUNTPOINT} starts at an offset of
 ${OFFSET} bytes from the minimum alignment for this disk, which may lead to
 very poor performance.
 .
 Since you are formatting this partition, you should correct this problem
 now by realigning the partition, as it will be difficult to change later.
 To do this, go back to the main partitioning menu, delete the partition,
 and recreate it in the same position with the same settings. This will
 cause the partition to start at a point best suited for this disk.
