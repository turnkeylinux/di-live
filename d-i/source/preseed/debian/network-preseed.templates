Description: Download debconf preconfiguration file

Template: preseed/url
Type: string
Description: Location of initial preconfiguration file:
 In order to perform an automated install, you need to supply a
 preconfiguration file (which can in turn pull in other files).
 To do that, you need to provide a (perhaps partial) URL.
 .
 This can be as simple as the machine name where your preseed
 files reside up to a full URL. Any of these could be made to work:
   intra		[for example.com, these three are equivalent]
   intra.example.com
   http://intra.example.com/d-i/./lenny/preseed.cfg
   http://192.168.0.1/~phil/test47.txt
   floppy://preseed.cfg
   file:///hd-media/kiosk/./preseed.cfg
 .
 For fully automated installs, preseed/url should itself be preseeded
 (via kernel command line, DHCP, or syslinux.cfg on customised media)
 .
 See http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed for inspiration.
