hw-detect (1.147) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add support for CHECK_MISSING_FIRMWARE=0 to hw-detect. This makes it
    possible for some callers (e.g. cdrom-detect, maybe iso-scan too) to
    avoid triggering firmware-related prompts when it's too early in the
    installation process to do anything about it (See: #991587, #991590).

  * Make the install-firmware script check both /firmware (PXE) and
    /cdrom/firmware (ISO) for patterns extracted from DEP-11 metadata,
    like check-missing-firmware does.

hw-detect (1.145) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Drop firmware-map file and surrounding logic: it never went further
    than a proof-of-concept, and we're approaching the firmware problem
    differently now (see: #989863).
  * If /firmware/dep11 is present (which should be the case starting with
    D-I Bullseye RC 3, for firmware-enabled images), query the udev
    database, extract modalias information, and use the patterns available
    under that directory to figure out which firmware packages might be
    helpful. Copy the relevant /firmware/<package>_*.deb files under
    /var/cache/firmware, and let the existing code enable non-free in
    apt-setup and install those packages in /target (see: #989863).
  * Check the actual module behind a given driver, since there might be a
    slight mismatch between the name coming up in dmesg (e.g. rtw_8821ce)
    and the actual module name (e.g. rtw88_8821ce). With many thanks to
    Daniel Lewart for the original patch (Closes: #973733).
  * Uniquify module list earlier in check-missing-firmware, to avoid
    repeating n times the same module if it requests n firmware files
    (e.g. iwlwifi).
  * Finally stop looking into the obsolete /dev/.udev/firmware-missing and
    /run/udev/firmware-missing locations, which were obsoleted upstream
    (udev) in 2013. This only generates noise in the installer's syslog.
  * When resuming parsing dmesg from a timestamp, just mention the
    timestamp in the log instead of the actual pattern, for better
    readability.
  * Set udevdir to /lib/udev/rules.d (instead of /etc/udev/rules.d), to
    appease lintian (udev-rule-in-etc).
  * Ignore iwl-debug-yoyo.bin requested by iwlwifi as it seems to be about
    debugging, it doesn't seem actually required, and it's not packaged
    anyway (see: #969264, 966218).

  * Make sure not to look at past lines in dmesg (Closes: #779546):
    - If user supplies firmware on a USB stick, missing firmware detection
      happens again, and if dmesg hasn't received enough lines to get rid of
      old “firmware: failed to load” entries, the situation looks like it
      hasn't improved.
    - To avoid such a loop, note the timestamp of the last dmesg line after
      having scanned for such lines, and in case missing firmware detection
      runs again, use this timestamp to filter out previous lines in case it's
      still present in the new dmesg output; or use the whole dmesg output if
      that timestamp has vanished.
    - Tested successfully on bare metal with iwlwifi.

    FireWire Ethernet devices are often a subdevice of the actual (PCI)
    controller and thus do not have vendor/device info under /sys/class/net.
    However, we can recognize FireWire devices by their bus type. Having this
    recognition should make it easier for users to identify their "regular"

  * Add support for detecting sbus devices on sparc now that we are not using
    discover anymore. May need to be extended to also add the drivers to the
    initramfs initrd or /etc/modules. Uses prtconf from sparc-utils-udeb.

hw-detect (1.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * I observed a scsi disk that required three seconds from the end of
    hw-detect until the kernel brought it up. (This may have involved udev,
    not sure). Try to deal with this kind of race slightly better in
    disk-detect by probing a few times with short pauses before concluding
    that there is no disk.

  * If d-i is using pcmciautils-udeb instead of pcmcia-cs-udeb (needed on

    drop old calls to udevstart/udevsynthesize.
  * Install discover1 in /target even if d-i is using udev, since X's

    - Don't install pcmcia-cs if hw-detect/start_pcmcia=false; at least on
      2.6 kernels, the /sys nodes can end up being present even if PCMCIA
      hasn't been started (Ubuntu bug #8678).
    - Fix DEB_HOST_ARCH_* compatibility code to handle the various special
      cases.
  * Joey Hess
    - Rename hw-detect-full to disk-detect.
    - Add a disk-detect command, which uses hw-detect to load any additional
      drivers, as hw-detect-full did, but which also checks to see if any
      disks were found, and if none are, allows the user to select driver
      modules from a list, or load more from a floppy. Closes: #283193
    - disk-detect will use partman's parted_devices command if available to
      see if any disks are found. Otherwise it falls back to a devfs find
      similar to that used by partitioner and autopartkit. This is probably
      good enough, but partman could be extended for network filesystems or
      something else and disk-detect's check would not know about it.
    - Move retry_params template to hw-detect so disk-detect can use it too.
      hw-detect might also use it in the future. Same with load_floppy
      template.
    - Remove ethdetect/modprobe_error template, as it's identical to
      hw-detect/modprobe_error. Use the latter in ethdetect.
    - Direct some modprobe output to /var/log/messages in ethdetect as is done
      in hw-detect.
    - Add a cleanup function to ethdetect.

    - Remove manual title setting.
    - hw-detect can now be called with a parameter that is the name of a
      debconf template. If it is, it will use that template as the title
      for the progress bar. This allows for cusomised progress bars
      during the different hardware detection steps. Of course, it's kinda a
      gyp because hw-detect still loads all the modules it can in each pass.

      cdrom-detect and iso-scan). Closes: #239429, #231105

    - If a module is not available, don't say we're loading it, instead
      mention that it was unavailable. The summary of unavailable modules is
      retained because it's easy to miss otherwise.
    - Remove the "(full version)" from hw-detect-full's menu item.

      load. Anyone who knows where a non-modprobe-able module is can use the
      shell..
    - Remove redundant ethdetect/title template, and unused
      ethdetect/module_prompt template.
    - hw-detect: collect any modprobe failures, and show them all in one
      screen at the end. Closes: #215163
    - hw-detect: Say "Loading module", not "Detected module", as not all
      the loaded modules were detected.
