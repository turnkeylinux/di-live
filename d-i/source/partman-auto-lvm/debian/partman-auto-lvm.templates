Template: partman-auto-lvm/new_vg_name
Type: string
Description: Name of the volume group for the new system:

Template: partman-auto-lvm/new_vg_name_exists
Type: string
Description: Name of the volume group for the new system:
 The selected volume group name is already in use. Please choose
 another name.

Template: partman-auto-lvm/unusable_recipe
Type: error
Description: Failed to partition the selected disk
 This happened because the selected recipe does not contain any partition
 that can be created on LVM volumes.

Template: partman-auto-lvm/no_boot
Type: boolean
Description: Continue installation without /boot partition?
 The recipe you selected does not contain a separate partition for /boot.
 This is normally needed to allow you to boot the system when using LVM.
 .
 You can choose to ignore this warning, but that may result in a failure to
 reboot the system after the installation is completed.

Template: partman-auto-lvm/vg_exists
Type: error
Description: Volume group name already in use
 The volume group name used to automatically partition using LVM is already
 in use. Lowering the priority for configuration questions will allow you
 to specify an alternative name.

Template: partman-auto-lvm/vg_create_error
Type: error
Description: Unexpected error while creating volume group
 Autopartitioning using LVM failed because an error occurred while creating
 the volume group.

Template: partman-auto-lvm/guided_size
Type: string
Default: some number
Description: Amount of volume group to use for guided partitioning:
 You may use the whole volume group for guided partitioning, or part of it.
 If you use only part of it, or if you add more disks later, then you will
 be able to grow logical volumes later using the LVM tools, so using a
 smaller part of the volume group at installation time may offer more
 flexibility.
 .
 The minimum size of the selected partitioning recipe is ${MINSIZE} (or
 ${PERCENT}); please note that the packages you choose to install may
 require more space than this. The maximum available size is ${MAXSIZE}.
 .
 Hint: "max" can be used as a shortcut to specify the maximum size, or
 enter a percentage (e.g. "20%") to use that percentage of the maximum size.

Template: partman-auto-lvm/bad_guided_size
Type: error
Description: Invalid input

Template: partman-auto-lvm/big_guided_size
Type: error
Description: ${SIZE} is too big
 You asked for ${SIZE} to be used for guided partitioning, but the available
 space is only ${MAXSIZE}.

Template: partman-auto-lvm/small_guided_size
Type: error
Description: ${SIZE} is too small
 You asked for ${SIZE} to be used for guided partitioning, but the selected
 partitioning recipe requires at least ${MINSIZE}.
