Description: In order to start your new system, the firmware on your Itanium system loads the boot loader from its private EFI partition on the hard disk.  The boot loader then loads the operating system from that same partition.  An EFI partition has a FAT16 file system formatted on it and the bootable flag set. Most installations place the EFI partition on the first primary partition of the same hard disk that holds the root file system.

_Description: Force UEFI installation?
 This machine's firmware has started the installer in UEFI mode but
 it looks like there may be existing operating systems already
 installed using "BIOS compatibility mode". If you
 continue to install Debian in UEFI mode, it might be difficult to
 reboot the machine into any BIOS-mode operating systems later.
 .
 If you wish to install in UEFI mode and don't care about
 keeping the ability to boot one of the existing systems, you have the
 option to force that here. If you wish to keep the option to boot an
 existing operating system, you should choose NOT to force UEFI
 installation here.
