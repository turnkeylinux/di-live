  * Manually loading loop kernel module when using squashfs images. For some
    reason, this doesn't get done automatically anymore.
  * Passing --yes to apt-get in remove-packages, otherwise the removal is not
    non-interactive anymore.
  * Unconditionally bind-mount /dev on /target after unpacking of the image,
    this needs to be done always and independently of udev anyway.
  * Correcting accidentally wrong kernel parameter in live-mode.

  [ Otavio Salvador ]
  * Clean up postinst to remove unused variables.
  * Add the required templates to provide translated progress info during
    live-installer.d hooks progress.
  * Add support to live image installing mode selection. Currently it
    support two modes: normal that unpacks the image and do the need
    changes to make it look just as a installed system system; live:
    unpacks the image but keep it running as live.
