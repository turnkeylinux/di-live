di-live - Debian Installer for Live systems
===========================================

Introduction
------------

Debian-installer (d-i) is the preferred way of installing debian based
systems. It runs in the initrd/initramfs (see notes/DebianInstaller).

di-live's objective is to provide the ability to install a "live" debian
based system direct to the harddisk, leveraging the power/flexability of
d-i, with a completely modular implementation (least amount of assumptions)
that can be used by upstream (eg. as an ubiquity depends - seperation of
concerns).

Source structure
----------------

di-live.py  - top level executable script (symlinked from bin/di-live)
di-live     - drives the installation (similar to d-i's main-menu)
di-live.d/  - component directory (executed in alpha-numeric ordering)
d-i/        - upstream d-i source code
compat/     - compatibility scripts as d-i code assumes running in 
              initrd/initramfs

cli syntax
----------

The init script will execute di-live (on new vt) using dialog frontend
(unless -d|--debug is used) if the boot param  "di-live" is present on
/proc/cmdline. di-live may be executed manually in a live system aswell.

Syntax: di-live [options]

Debian Installer Live

Drives the installation, executing components according to alpha-numeric
ordering, and responsible for dynamically assembling the menu and
executing components when they are selected.

Similar to d-i's main-menu, di-live's menu will only be visible when
debconf priority is low or medium. Priority is reduced when a component
fails, and returns to original level when next component completes 
successfully.

Options:
  -d --debug      Set DEBCONF_DEBUG=developer DEBIAN_FRONTEND=readline
